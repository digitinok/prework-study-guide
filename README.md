# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help Bootcamp students through the prework for the front-end developer course. The Webpage supplies notes on the covered topics HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A - It's a web page, so a web browser might help to view it.

## Usage

You can review the notes on HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript in the relevant section. For ideas on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools  ( `Command+Option+I` o macOS or `Control+Shift+I` on Windows). A console panel should open in the browser - below or to the side of the webpage. There you can see a list of topics to study for the prework and get inspired by a suggestion on which topic to study first.
